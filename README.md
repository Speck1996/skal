<h1 align="center">SKAL! Speck's keras anomaly library (WIP!)</h1>


## ABOUT 
This project is built upon the work I have done for my master thesis (see [thesis summary](docs/thesis_summary.pdf)) and it is primarly inspired by Intel's [anomalib](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib).

After spending more than a year working on my thesis and a few months more trying to get the results to publish a paper, I have decided to totally refactor the code I wrote into a library during my free time. Unfortunately during my thesis I focused mainly on getting the results to publish a paper, rapidly prototyping ideas with python notebooks without giving a proper structure to my code.

Unlike Intel's [anomalib](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/anomalib), this library is based on keras and it leverages the full potential of keras processing layers which, in my opinion, make the process of inference way more compact and cleaner.

This is nothing too serious, just a hobby project to keep up to date with generative anomaly detection models and the latest releases of keras (my main goal is porting the tensorflow code to jax or torch, once [keras core](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) is mature enough).
